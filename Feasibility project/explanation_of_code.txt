Explanation of code:

We iterate over each row using iterrows with for loop

1) Save each character in a street_name variable until we encounter a digit.

2) When we encounter a digit, it could be because of the two possible cases :
   a) It would be part of the street name
		OR
   b) It would be part of the Country_code

3) To check it
We make a nested while loop which stores the next characters that we encounter in a
"spcl_str" variable.

We break the loop only if we encounter a space char " " or if the character is not a digit.

Then we check the length of spcl_str.
If it is 5, it means that we encountered continuous block of 5 digits which indicates that it is the Country_Code.
We save it as country code and break the outer while loop. Then we go on to get the city name

If its length is less than 5, it means that we encountered a different character and not a digit.
This indicates that,
spcl_str should be part of street_name.
We continue with the outer while loop again.

4) We run while loop until our counter's (i) value is less than length of adress an save it in city_name variable.
